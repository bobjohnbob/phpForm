This is just a small project I put together to learn some php and to practice coding way back when I was working at bluehost.  It also seemed like something that I might be able to use often enough. It is a PHP that accepts a form submition, send the information in an email and redirects to a configured page (with recaptcha support).  It was designed to be a very simple to configure for someone who knew html and could make a form but didn't know how to process it on the backend.  The idea is that someone can drop it in their html root, change one thing in the config file, point their form to it and it should work. :)
